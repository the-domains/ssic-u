[Our Mission][0]

---

Over the years Sales Representatives and Independent Contractors have progressively struggled. Times when an employer was able to take advantage of them knowing you don't have much legal protection is discouraging...

I believe the loss of income from those of us at the bottom by unprotected firing rights, breaches of contracts unpaid commissions and the like has hurt the entire US economy. The people at the top are ok with sharing as they have constantly siad through out recent years. We just don't have a single voice, our voices have been scattered since the beginning and in today's economics we can't afford it any longer.

Not all employers that hire sales reps are giving unwarranted difficulties but the good model of those company's should be standard for all the people in the sales field and not just the great company's some of us have been fortunate enough to get hired at.

Our goal is to help all men and women in the sales field reach the point of being gainfully employed, secure on their job and as stable as non-sales related positions in their particular industry. You do not have to settle for workplace hostility, and there are too many great companies to work for that truly will appreciate you.

We offer [free sales training][1], employment assistance, and a legal team dedicated to ensuring you are free to be your best and are being treated with civility. Services that are included free with your membership.

Our goal is to help you stay your best, keep you trained and employed and free to focus on selling, supporting and representing your employer(s) with the professionalism they deserve.

Though salespeople are often viewed in a negative light, not because we are bad people, it was actually due to the fact that we didn't have Public Relations Representatives, like the NBA, NHL, MLB, NFL players, or top political and public figures.

[Join][1] our community of professionals to help us keeps our industry great.

1Timothy 5:18 for the scripture says, Thou shalt not muzzle an ox that treadeth out corn, and, The workman _is_ worthy of his hire.
